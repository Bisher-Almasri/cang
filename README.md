# CAng

**CAng** is an interpreted programming language designed around resource constraints. In this language, you have a limited number of "coins" to spend on different features.
For example, you might start with 10 variable coins and 3 function coins. You can earn more coins by completing in-interpreter quests, such as "add 5 print calls" or "run a program 100 times."

Then, run `cang`.

Iâ€™ve adjusted the flow, made some grammar fixes, and polished the formatting. Does this work better for you?
