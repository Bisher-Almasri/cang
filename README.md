# CAng

**CAng** is an interpreted programming language where your programs are written under a resource constraint: you have a limited amount of "coins" to spend on language features.  
Example: you might start with 10 variable coins and 3 function coins. You earn more coins by completing in-interpreter quests such as "add 5 print calls" or "run a program 100 times".
